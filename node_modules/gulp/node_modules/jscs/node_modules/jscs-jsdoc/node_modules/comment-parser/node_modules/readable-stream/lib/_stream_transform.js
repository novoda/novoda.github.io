// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.
